        <p>
          Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the 
          Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After 
          joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become 
          Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the 
          villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure 
          no Eiyū, Literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth 
          Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, 
          Literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).

        <span>Background</span>
        <p>Naruto was born on the night of October 10th to Minato Namikaze (the Fourth Hokage) and Kushina Uzumaki (the second 
          jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails). He was named after Naruto Musasabi, the protagonist of Jiraiya's first book, which made the 
          Sannin his godfather.cThe Third Hokage made special arrangements for Minato to preserve Kushina's seal containing the 
          Nine-Tails while she gave birth to Naruto in a remote location, escorted by midwives and Anbu. A masked man, Tobi, tracked 
          down their location, however, killed the midwives and Anbu, and captured Naruto, forcing Minato to quickly rescue him and 
          teleport him to a safe house.
